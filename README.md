# Mushroom-Classification
The “mushroom” dataset is used to train many different Machine Learning models. These models are analyzed by their accuracy and error using error metrics like confusion matrix. These models are compared using AUC and ROC curves to determine which model suits the best for this classification.
Through the output generated by the chosen machine learning model, it is able to determine whether the mushroom is edible or poisonous.
